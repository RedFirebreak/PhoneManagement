Hi there!

We recommend scrcpy for adb and opening the phone's screen.
You can download their files here: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy

Make sure to download the windows zip files and put them in the scrcpy folder.
Adb and scrcpy should be accessable from \PhoneManagement\scrcpy\adb.exe

Thanks for understanding :)
